# titile : function.audpc.R; 
# purpose : generate AUDPC; 
# producer : A. H. Sparks et. al 2007; 
# last update : In Los Ba√±os, 1 Jul. 2014;
# inputs : disease severity measurements over time;
# outputs : data frame named sheet1, sheet2, sheet3 and sheet4 
# remarks 1 : based on AUDPC script found in: : Sparks, A.H., P.D. Esker, M. Bates, W. Dall' Acqua, Z. Guo, V. Segovia, S.D. Silwal, S. Tolos, and K.A.
